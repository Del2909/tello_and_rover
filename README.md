# Symbiotic Power and Data Sharing: DJI Tello Drone and Rover

This project is designed to create a symbiotic relationship between a [DJI Tello drone](https://www.dji.com/tello) and a custom rover. The Tello drone captures aerial images to compute an optimal path for the rover, while the rover not only performs path computation and completion tasks but also serves as a charging platform for the drone. This integration is made possible through the development of unique features like path computation and autonomous landing algorithms.

## Features

- **Aerial Image Capture:** The DJI Tello drone is equipped to capture high-resolution aerial images for path computation.
- **Optimal Path Computation:** Our custom algorithm processes the aerial images to compute the most efficient path for the rover.
- **Autonomous Operation:** The rover has been designed to autonomously navigate the computed path.
- **Charging Platform:** The rover features a built-in charging platform compatible with the DJI Tello drone.
- **Autonomous Landing:** Post aerial image capture, the drone autonomously lands on the rover for recharging.

## Critical Notes
Please note that the DJI Tello drone requires at least 40 percent battery for one round of autonomous takeoff, path computation, and landing. Ensure sufficient battery before initiating the operation.

We are continuously working to improve the efficiency and functionality of our system. Feel free to report any issues or contribute to our project.
